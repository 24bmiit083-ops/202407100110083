        One of my favorite ways to relax and express creativity is through 
        <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">photography</span>. 
        I enjoy capturing nature, cityscapes, and candid moments. 
        <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Photography</span> allows me to tell stories without words and preserve memories in a meaningful way.
